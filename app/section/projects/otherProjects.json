    "description": "I had the opportunity to work on an intriguing podcast series that delved into the complex topics of propaganda, collaboration, resistance, persecution, and exile during the Nazi occupation of many European countries. Collaborating with international musicologists and historians, my role involved editing and curating the episodes to ensure a seamless and engaging experience. I also focused on developing a visually appealing brand identity and incorporating immersive sound design. Additionally, I implemented a social media strategy to actively engage with listeners and encourage meaningful discussions. It was a rewarding experience to be a part of this thought-provoking project.",
